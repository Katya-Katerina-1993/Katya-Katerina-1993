- My name is Ekaterina. I'm 29 years old. 
- A year and a half ago, I realized that everything was not right 🚫 and I needed changes. So I'm retraining (again, yes 😄 knowledge is light 💡) to a full-stack JavaScript developer. 
- I'm more interested in the frontend, but who knows, maybe the backend will win my heart 💘 
- But while I'm conquering native JavaScript 🧗🏻‍♀️ adaptive cross-browser semantic layout has already been mastered 💪🏻
- Update: for now, my target is Vue.js 🎯
